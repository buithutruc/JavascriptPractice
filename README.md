Practices #1 to #5: followed instructions of Per Harald Borgen at https://youtu.be/jS4aFq5-91M. Some extra features and functions are added by myself.
1. Counter app: count the number of people entering a metro. 
2. Simple calculator app: users will enter 2 numbers. The app allows them to add/substract/divide/multiply the numbers and display the result on the screen The clear button is to reset the entered numbers and the result. 
3. Blackjack game: a simple game to play blackjack
4. Chrome extention: a simple chrome extension to save your favourite urls
